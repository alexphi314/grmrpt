    <h4>What is Blue Moon Groom?</h4>
    <p>
        Blue Moon Groom is a daily grooming report delivered to your phone or email.
        It analyzes daily grooming reports issued by ski resorts for you, reporting today's "Blue Moon"
        runs.
    </p>
    <h4>What are "Blue Moon" runs?</h4>
    <p>
        "Blue Moon" runs are the ski runs on today's grooming report that are only groomed
        once or twice a week -- they're the runs groomed "once in a blue moon".
    </p>
    <h4>How and when will I receive the grooming report?</h4>
    <p>
        When signing up, you can elect to receive the reports via text message (free) or email. You
        can also specify which days of the week you would like to receive the report. Reports are usually
        delivered between 6 am and 8 am MST, depending on when the ski resort posts today's grooming report.
    </p>
